I am a Master's Computer Science student at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu) where I am a member of [Active Perception Group](https://yezhouyang.engineering.asu.edu/research-group/) advised by Prof. [Yezhou Yang](http://yezhouyang.engineering.asu.edu) and co-advised by Prof. [Yi Ren](http://semte.engineering.asu.edu/ren-yi/).

My research is focused on improving reliability and robustness of intelligent systems through adversarial machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and reinforcement learning.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [National Institute of Technology, Warangal](https://www.nitw.ac.in), India where I was an undergraduate researcher under the guidance of Prof. [Raju Bhukya](https://www.nitw.ac.in/faculty/id/16343/).
