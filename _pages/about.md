I am currently a Software Development Engineer 2 at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com) under [SCOT](http://bit.ly/amazon-scot) team.

I earned my MS Computer Science degree from [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu) where I was a member of [Active Perception Group](https://yezhouyang.engineering.asu.edu/research-group/) advised by Prof. [Yezhou Yang](http://yezhouyang.engineering.asu.edu) and co-advised by Prof. [Yi Ren](http://semte.engineering.asu.edu/ren-yi/). My primary research focus in MS was understanding behaviour of AI under certain adversarial perturbations and improving the robustness in deep reinforcement learning, computer vision, and machine learning methods. More specifically, worked on exploiting deep reinforcement learning agents for autononomous driving to study the robustness under different possible threats.

Before MS, I worked as a Data Engineer at [Target](http://target.com) where I developed multiple extract, transform, and load processes for the movement of big data. Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [National Institute of Technology, Warangal](https://www.nitw.ac.in), India where I was an undergraduate researcher under the guidance of Prof. [Raju Bhukya](https://www.nitw.ac.in/faculty/id/16343/).
