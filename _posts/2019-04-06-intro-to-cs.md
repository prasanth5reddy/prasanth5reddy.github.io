<p>I want to start this with a story of myself getting introduced to computer science and programming. When I was around 13 years old, my sister showed me a program in <em>C</em> that prints <b>Hello World</b>. I assume most of the people started the same thing but may be with a different programming language. But my real journey in computer science started off at the age of 17 when I took computer science and engineering major during my Bachelors. That's too much talking, eh? Okay, Let's get to the point</p>

<h3 id="heading3">What is Computer Science?</h3>
<p>In simple terms, computer science is a theoritical understanding of what machines can do. I wrote machines instead of computer because now a days there are other machines beside computer which can compute and often not called as computer. But in terms of understanding all of them are same. I personally feel computer science is a field that strongly relates to mathematics than any other because math is everyday life.</p>

<h3 id="heading3">What is Programming?</h3>
<p>computer programming is an art of expressing your thoughts and intentions to a computer and in return it does the same. Let's say you want to know the first 5 natural numbers from a computer. You code and make the computer understand your intent. Then boom! your computer gave you what you need. In the end, programming is a practical way of learning computer science.</p>

<h3 id="heading3">Why to learn?</h3>
<p>To solve the problems and make your everyday life simple and efficient. If you are a math teacher, it can provide you with a long list of prime numbers which is difficult for human to remember. If you are an accountant, it can balance the money for you. There are much more things that can be done and every one has their own opinion on why to learn. Too much reading? Watch a video below to get inspired.</p>

<h3 id="heading3">How to learn?</h3>
<p>If you are excited to start and learn computer science and programming, then there are tons and tons of material available on the web and internet. Make search engines your best friend. There are some amazing websites such as <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">coursera</a>, <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edx</a> and often youtube to learn. <em>CS50 Harvard</em>, A little hint here!</p>

<h3 id="heading3">What can be done?</h3>
<p>Well, there is a lot that can be achieved through computer science. Below is a small list of subfields in it. If you are afraid that you don't understand the terms, that's okay. Get started somewhere and it all makes sense.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mathematics - solve the math problems</li>
<li>Networks - build a cool messenger</li>
<li>Security - don't compromise on privacy</li>
<li>Operating Systems - Windows / macOS</li>
<li>Databases - store the data</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence - self driving cars</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for the reading. I hope this gave you an intuition on computer science and programming subject.</p>
